# SDIR (Self-Defining Intermediate Representation) Concept

## Philosophy
The concept of SDIR revolves around the idea of having a metalanguage that allows for self-defining blueprints. This innovative approach aims to enable blueprints to define their own syntax and semantics, eliminating the need for external Domain-Specific Language (DSL) compilers.

## Design
SDIR provides a construction framework where components can self-describe without relying on a fixed structure, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in design.

## Implementation Path
1. **Define Core Principles:** Identify the foundational rules governing the syntax and semantics of SDIR.
2. **Establish Component Framework:** Create a system that harnesses SDIR to define components dynamically.
3. **Testing and Validation:** Rigorous testing to ensure that SDIR definitions are executable and meet the desired specifications.
